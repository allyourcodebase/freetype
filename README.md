This is [freetype](https://freetype.org/) packaged for [Zig](https://ziglang.org/).

## Comparison with mach-freetype

Please consider using [mach-freetype](https://github.com/hexops/mach-freetype).

I was not aware of mach-freetype when I made this repository and I have not yet
evaluated either one's suitability for my personal project.
